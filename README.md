ðŸš¢ Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, a well-known dataset available on Kaggle. The goal is to explore the relationships between various features and the likelihood of survival during the Titanic disaster.
ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their age, gender, class, fare, and whether they survived or not. This project explores the following aspects:

    Data Cleaning:
        Handling missing values in the Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns.
        Filling missing values with appropriate strategies (e.g., median for continuous variables, mode for categorical variables).

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Survival Analysis: Investigating the survival rate based on passenger class, age, and gender.
        Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations to uncover patterns and trends in the data.
        Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing key statistics for various features in the dataset.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

    Class and Survival: Passengers in 1st class had a significantly higher survival rate compared to those in 2nd and 3rd classes.
    Age Distribution: Younger passengers, especially children, had a higher chance of survival.
    Gender and Survival: Females had a much higher survival rate compared to males.

ðŸ”§ Tools and Technologies

    Python: The analysis was conducted using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
    Jupyter Notebook: All code and analysis are documented in a Jupyter Notebook for ease of understanding and reproducibility.

ðŸš€ How to Use

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Install the required dependencies (listed in requirements.txt).
    Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to replicate the analysis.

ðŸ“‚ Files in the Repository

    dataset.csv: The Titanic dataset used for the analysis.
    interchip_DS_Task02.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the data cleaning and EDA process.


ðŸ’¡ Future Work

    Implementing machine learning models to predict survival based on the features.
    Further analysis on other aspects of the dataset, such as ticket numbers and cabin locations.
